## What is this about?
Upping your security game through better web security

You can't drop a bastion in your network setup to proxy all your SSH connections and blacklist all but that IP to connect to your servers? Can't pipe all of  your servers to your local PKI/Radius to check on the validity of the certificate used to connect and have to do it manually? Well, the least you can do is follow these steps then!

Also, anyone up for some SSH through [Avian carriers](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1149)?

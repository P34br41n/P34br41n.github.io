# What is this about?
Anything related to hardware, electronics, homemade, ..., will end up here.

# Warning
Sometimes messing up things means that you die. Well this is one of those times! :D

## What do I need for this?
There is a basic shopping list [right here](./shopping-list), it's clearly not complete and doesn't cover edge cases, but if you're already using a [BGA rework station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rework_(electronics)) daily you're probably going to skip this anyway.
Also, this wont cover the designing, layering, gerber files, and so on, concepts. Go get [KiCad](https://github.com/KiCad) or something and go checkout some _electronics 101_ courses online and maybe some tutorials on youtube.

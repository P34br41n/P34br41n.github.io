title: ATtiny 85
---

## What is this about?
A homemade Rubber Ducky/BadUSB with an [ATtiny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATtiny_microcontroller_comparison_chart).

## What does it do?
Emulate a keyboard and run commands on a computer.

## The Setup
There a a couple of options here, you can buy a chip and solder it to a board with a usb plug with a couple of resistors, pull-up, ... and you're good to go, or simply buy the whole thing for a couple of bucks, your call.

I won't cover popping open a standard usb key, dumping & flashing a new firmware here, but adding a _run this code before setting up the storage part_ or _wait for a bit before IDing as a keyboard and run the code_ on a usb key isn't that hard to setup either.

### One shot

Pick a lib that support [your board](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/damellis/attiny/ide-1.6.x-boards-manager/package_damellis_attiny_index.json), also random guess you'll need [this](http://digistump.com/package_digistump_index.json).

Push the code

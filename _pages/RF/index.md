# Warning
Having RF jamming equipment just because is illegal more or less everywhere, actively running RF jamming equipment is, you guessed it, also illegal. Don't be a dick and start jamming stuff randomly just because you can, people's life sometime depend on it and you're going to get [nuked into orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_jamming#Legal_instruments) if you do.

# What is this about?
RTL-SDR, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, ..., will end up here.

## Cell phones

## Wi-Fi 
Need access to a network but can't get in the building? Can't go around [warshipping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warshipping) stuff? No [fiber tapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiber_tapping) gear laying around? Well then this is for you!

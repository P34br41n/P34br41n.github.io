title: The Open Frequencies
---

# What is this about?
Some frequencies are heavily restricted, but some are open to play with (check your country regulations though). You might push this even further and get an amateur radio operator license, but if you aren't made out of cash then get or build a Faraday cage and you should be good, but shit happens so be careful...

433MHz is a global open game freq, but most countries have their specifics on how you're supposed to use it, so check that out too before running your stuff. If you need more info about all of this you can check [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short-range_device) out, or just Google stuff ;)
